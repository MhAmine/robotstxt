Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://cran.rstudio.com/
    From: README.md
    Status: 200
    Message: OK
    CRAN URL not in canonical form
  A canonical CRAN URL starts with https://cran.r-project.org/
```
  
--> This URL is indeed as intended as it refers to that one particular CRAN mirror and not all CRAN pages in general.
